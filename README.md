# WeatherCanPicYourMusic ⛅️📸🎧

Welcome to WeatherCanPicYourMusic, where the skies set your playlist! This unique platform crafts a music recommendation list based on the day's weather, requiring just a photo from you. Below is the magic that makes it happen.

## Weather Image Classification

* **Image Understanding**: After training various cutting-edge image classification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, such as VGG, ResNet, and Xception, we utilized a pre-trained 'Xception', suitable to  distinguish diverse weather patterns: sunny☀️, rainy☔️, foggy🌫️, snowy🌨️, and sunset/sunrise 🌅.
* **Data Sources**: Amassed an extensive dataset from Kaggle and Google Images to fine-tune our model for accurate recognition.

## Music Recommendation

* **Data Scraping Tools**: Employed Selenium and Beautiful Soup to curate a music database rich with details like song titles, artists, albums, tags, and popularity metrics from various playlists. Tags are basically keywords that the owner of the playlist puts up when creating the playlist, which means it describes the mood or the tone of the playlist, which makes it easier for other users to choose and understand their playlist.
* **Cultural Touch**: Tapped into South Korea's music platforms, such as Melon and Genie, extracting songs from weather-themed playlists by using speciifc keywords relevant to the weather (e.g., 화창한 날 for sunny days, 비 오는 날 for rainy days).

## Music - Weather Similarity

* **Semantic Analysis**: Analyzed playlist tags with 'Word2Vec' to establish the mood-weather relationship, ensuring that tags accurately reflect the atmospheric conditions they represent.

## Personalized Recommendations

* **Unique Scoring**: Combined likes, tag-weather similarity, and frequency of weather-specific mentions to generate a tailored list of 10 songs.

## Platform Accessibility

* **Streamlit Integration**: Embedded our system into Streamlit, allowing for easy access and user interaction. Simply download our model ('xception_model_1.h5' in the 'final_model' folder) and the Streamlit page files (Home.py, 'pages' folder) to get started.
* **Open for All**: Anyone can run the website on their local machine and enjoy personalized music recommendations 😊
